Context

_(the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change)_

This decision record states that the JSON message format is adopted as standard in REST service communication

Decision
~~~~~~~~
_(What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing)?_

This decision states that the strategy to carry out the pagination feature with MongoDB is based on skip/limit strategy

https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/paging-with-the-bucket-pattern--part-1

  .find().sort("field": 1).skip(<size>*(<page>-1)).limit(<size>)
  
Each service returns an  PaginationResponse object

pagination protocol:
  1. First request with count parameter return AmlPageImpl.totalCount
  n. request with page,size parameters return AmlPageImpl.content

Consequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~
_(What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?)_

skip/limit strategy requires scanning all the docs before reaching the page position. 

cons
- It becomes slower as the offset increases, response times decline as page numbers increase
- Due concurrent add or remove, fetch may lead to duplicated or not fetching docs in the result

pros
- skip/limit strategy allows direct access to a page
